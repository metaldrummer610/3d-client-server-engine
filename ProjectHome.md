The purpose of this project is provide a generic framework for creating networked games using SDL and OpenGL.

My plans for the engine include:
  * Using C++ to write the server and the client
  * Using the networking library enet (http://enet.bespin.org/)
  * Using OpenGL with SDL underneath it for the graphics and input/output. (http://www.opengl.org/) (http://www.libsdl.org/)
  * Eventually include Python or some other scripting language like lua for the objects that are in-game. (http://www.python.org/) (http://www.lua.org/)
  * Possibly implement some sort of protocol that will make communications between the clients and the server more efficient.
  * At some point down the road, figure out how to include artificial intelligence.
